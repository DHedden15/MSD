# lee.py
**ELIZA** is a natural language processing program developed from 1964 to 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum, 
originally implemented in MAD-SLIP. 
You can read the 1966 paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365153.365168). 

ELIZA uses pattern matching, decomposition and reassembly rules 
to emulate a Rogerian psychotherapist.
